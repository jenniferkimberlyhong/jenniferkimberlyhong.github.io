      <p class="bio">I fell in love with design at a young age. I spent most my childhood drawing, especially fashion designs and as I entered high school, I began a club with a group of other students in high school dedicated to fashion. We created our own mini magazines and held a yearly show for the school. In 2009, I enrolled in a prestigious design program in New York but felt financially burdened and made a personal decision to leave.</p>
      <p class="bio-two">I transferred to Rutgers University in New Brunswick and graduated in May 2014 with a degree in Economics and Human Resource Management. I believe my studies taught me to understand human behavior and success in business. After graduation, I started as a graduate business consultant at multinational IT company. I was introduced to many different software applications and quickly learned the tools and skills to provide client success in implementation and upgrade projects. I loved working in technology and continually learning and adapting to new products in the fast-pace industry while helping clients towards their goals. After 2 years, I became promoted to a senior technology consultant.</p>
      <p class="bio-three">In my 5 years of experience in technology consulting, it has provided me the skills to understand client requirements to provide agile solutioning, analyze data, testing, and streamlining business processes. My love for design never left throughout the years and design continues to play a key role in my day to day life working with software products. In working with these various products during projects, I get to view it from the end users perspective of how it affects their daily tasks. I was able to understand the design flaws and areas not intuitive to new users. And from these project experiences, I realized I wanted to work on the creative side with the clients to understand their problems and provide innovative design solutions that will make their tasks easier and working with technology fun.</p>
